# 🌐 Smart Parking Slot Management System

💻 **Web Application | Public Project**

A browser-based smart parking management system designed to digitize parking operations — from vehicle entry to exit billing and admin-level revenue analytics.

Instead of being a static booking page, the system behaves like a **complete parking workflow engine**, handling slot allocation, ticketing, exit processing, and historical analysis in one interface.

- Application flow design  
- State management  
- Business rules (billing, batching, analytics)  
- Admin vs user separation  

It serves as a strong foundation for future upgrades like **backend APIs, databases, and real-time synchronization**.
